  Understanding what you are required to do
</h3>

**Choosing the right approach** for anything in life is a critical decision that can significantly impact your development process and the success of your endevours. This relates to development and design solutions btw :-)

> How quickly or stable do I want things in my life to be?
> Sometimes there is a need for things to get done as quickly as possible to get the ball rolling and test outcomes. Other times it takes a little more time to know how things work under the hood so as to come up with the most bare-bone implimentation that just works

I'll use an example of a simple online store. Does the business need to accomplish having the store online quickly/easily so as to move stock ASAP and give logistics to a third party or do they need to ensure a seamless and stable flow from customer transaction to delivery location, verified reviews, ratings and etc.

**Understanding the problem will always inform you if you need to go fast and break things or go slow and never have to look back.**

How much tech debt are you willing to take on...in software and life in general.
